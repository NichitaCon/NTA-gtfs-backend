Hello!

This is a backend that i made for my irish public transport app, it consumes the live gtfs api and static gtfs and outputs endpoints that are clean and accessible from react native

Mainly made this because the gtfs standard is so annoying to work with so id rather have all the processing happen in the backend instead of doing weird unnecessarily complicated joins on mobile
